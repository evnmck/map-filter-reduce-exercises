# Forms!

Create a form to collect data from the user.

The form can be anything. Here are some suggestions: login, shipping, taxes.
You can make it completely silly!

## Stretch

* Use the form to do a dynamic API call and populate the page (posts from a user specified subreddit such as [aww.json](https://www.reddit.com/r/aww.json)) (specific details of a [pokemon](http://pokeapi.co/))
* Create a custom control for your form using JavaScript and/or JQuery
* Change some information on the page based on what the user of entered in real-time
